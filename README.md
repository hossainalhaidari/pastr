# pastr

**pastr** is a super-minimal URL shortener and paste tool that has a dead-simple convention for using it which uses a flat-file storage and has no dependencies.

## Usage

- (Optional) Set `PASTR_HOST` to `http://localhost:3000`.
- (Optional) Set `PASTR_KEY_LENGTH` to a number between 4 and 12 (default: 4).
- Run `go run .` to start the server locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Call the API by prepending `=` before the content you want to shorten:

```
    http://localhost:3000/=Hello, World!
    http://localhost:3000/=http://mysite.com
```

- In response, you will see something like the following; which is your shortened URL:

```
    http://localhost:3000/6e17
    http://localhost:3000/e85c
```

- If you used a URL as the content, then by opening the shortened link you will be redirected to the original URL; otherwise it will be displayed as plain text.
